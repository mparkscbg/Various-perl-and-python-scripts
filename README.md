# Various-perl-and-python-scripts
A collection of various perl and python scripts for data processing.

Caveat emptor: these scripts are in most cases put together in the spirit of brusque functionality, meaning I can't recommend them as examples of 'best scripting practices' and they certainly will never be considered in the hall of fame for script writing!

With that said, they should work by and large (no guarantees), and are offered as free and available for usage and modification. Good luck!
